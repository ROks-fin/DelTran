Instead of immobilising capital across many pre-funded accounts, regulated institutions should be able to move value in seconds on corridors where licensing, supervision and risk appetite allow it.\n\nToday DelTran is in a pre-launch phase with a working MVP and completed internal performance tests. We are preparing our first regulatory submissions, starting with ADGM, and speaking with banks, EMIs and PSPs that see strategic value in freeing trapped settlement capital and improving multilateral netting."
